# DigiCart
# Shopping website created using Django ( offcourse by me 	&#128513;).
<p>This is a shopping website which has different sections like Mobiles, Laptops, Grocery ( only 4 item per section). It has authentication system. It has one regsitration form for customer to get registered to shop online.</p>
<hr>
<h2><b>Working : </b></h2><span> When user first loads the site he/she can see all the items ( responsive site so no problem according to any screen) If he/she tries to add to cart or buy item then site first takes the customer to the login  page if not a registered user then need to register first. After registratrion add to cart and buy option works fine. Add to cart option add the details of the product to cart section there after checkout can be done ( dummy not actual gateway).  If buy option is choosen then direct payment page for that items opens. Order history is also mentained which can be seen or cleaned by user from his profile.</span>
